imgur-api-readonly
=========================

A quick public facing way to access a few of the read-only methods in the Imgur API.

Intended as a way to get some JSON back to small public sketches that users shouldn't have to have to create their own servers for.

## Currently supported methods:

`https://imgur-api-readonly.glitch.me/image/{{id}}`

`https://imgur-api-readonly.glitch.me/album/{{id}}`
